## **Installation**

To get started with Mementum, install the SDK:

```bash
pip install mementum-sdk
```

Alternatively, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mementum-ai/mementum-sdk.git
cd mementum-sdk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Set up environment variables in a `.env` file (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

---

## **Quick Start**

### **Example: AI Content Generation**

Generate AI-powered content such as text, images, or videos.

```python
from sdk import MementumAI

# Initialize AI module
ai = MementumAI()

# Generate text
text_content = ai.generate_text("Create a market analysis report.")
print(f"Generated Text: {text_content}")

# Generate an image
image_url = ai.generate_image("A futuristic cityscape at sunset.")
print(f"Generated Image URL: {image_url}")
```

---

### **Example: Blockchain Interactions**

Interact with the blockchain to transfer tokens, query balances, or stake tokens.

```python
from sdk import BlockchainInteractions

# Initialize blockchain module
blockchain = BlockchainInteractions()

# Get token balance
balance = blockchain.get_balance("your_wallet_address")
print(f"Token Balance: {balance} $MEME")

# Transfer tokens
tx_hash = blockchain.transfer_tokens(
    sender_private_key="your_private_key",
    recipient="recipient_wallet_address",
    amount=100
)
print(f"Transaction Hash: {tx_hash}")

# Stake tokens
staking_contract = blockchain.get_staking_contract()
staking_contract.stake("your_private_key", 50)
print("Tokens staked successfully!")
```

---

### **Example: NFT Minting**

Mint NFTs representing digital content.

```python
from sdk import BlockchainInteractions

# Initialize blockchain module
blockchain = BlockchainInteractions()

# Mint an NFT
nft_contract = blockchain.get_nft_contract()
tx_hash = nft_contract.mint_nft("your_wallet_address")
print(f"NFT Minted! Transaction Hash: {tx_hash}")
```

---

### **Example: Governance Voting**

Participate in governance by voting on proposals.

```python
from sdk import BlockchainInteractions

# Initialize blockchain module
blockchain = BlockchainInteractions()

# Vote on a proposal
governance_contract = blockchain.get_governance_contract()
proposal_id = 1
vote_support = True  # True for "Yes", False for "No"
tx_hash = governance_contract.vote("your_private_key", proposal_id, vote_support)
print(f"Vote submitted! Transaction Hash: {tx_hash}")
```

---

## **SDK Structure**

The SDK is organized into modular components for ease of use and maintainability:

- **`__init__.py`**: Marks the directory as a Python package and exposes key classes/functions.
- **`mementum_ai.py`**: Houses AI logic for generating multi-modal content (text, images, videos).
- **`mementum_api.py`**: Manages REST or GraphQL endpoints for interacting with the platform's backend.
- **`blockchain_interactions.py`**: Provides utility functions for blockchain interactions (e.g., transferring tokens, querying balances, minting NFTs, staking).
- **`config.py`**: Centralizes configuration loading (e.g., API keys, contract addresses).
- **`errors.py`**: Defines custom exceptions for better error handling.
- **`logging_config.py`**: Standardizes logging setup for consistent outputs.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains reusable helper functions (e.g., data validation, text formatting).

---

## **Configuration**

The SDK uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
AI_API_KEY=your_ai_service_api_key
PLATFORM_API_KEY=your_platform_api_key
BLOCKCHAIN_PROVIDER_URL=https://rpc-url
CONTRACT_ADDRESS_MEME_TOKEN=your_meme_token_contract_address
CONTRACT_ADDRESS_GOVERNANCE=your_governance_contract_address
CONTRACT_ADDRESS_NFT=your_nft_contract_address
CONTRACT_ADDRESS_STAKING=your_staking_contract_address
```

These variables are automatically loaded by the `Config` class in `config.py`.

---

## **Error Handling**

The SDK includes custom exception classes for better error reporting:

- **`BlockchainError`**: Raised for blockchain-related issues (e.g., failed transactions).
- **`AIServiceError`**: Raised for AI service-related issues (e.g., failed content generation).

Example:

```python
from sdk.errors import BlockchainError, AIServiceError

try:
    tx_hash = blockchain.transfer_tokens(sender_private_key, recipient, amount)
except BlockchainError as e:
    print(f"Blockchain Error: {e}")
```

---

## **Logging**

The SDK standardizes logging for debugging and monitoring. Logs are formatted as:

```
[timestamp] - [module] - [log level] - [message]
```

Example:

```python
from sdk.logging_config import logger

logger.info("This is an informational message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
```
