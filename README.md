# Mementum: AI-Powered Trading & Content Creation on Solana

## Overview

Mementum is an AI-driven platform that combines trading automation, content generation, and decentralized governance using the Solana blockchain. The ecosystem revolves around  **$MEME** , an ERC-20 (or equivalent) token, enabling AI-assisted trading, NFT minting, and governance mechanisms.

Mementum's SDK provides seamless integration with AI services and blockchain functionalities, allowing developers to:

* Generate AI-powered multimedia content (text, images, videos).
* Interact with smart contracts (trading, staking, governance).
* Utilize a secure and modular framework for decentralized AI applications.

## Features

* **$MEME Token** : A secure ERC-20 (or equivalent) token with minting, burning, and transfer functionalities.
* **AI Content Generation** : Multi-modal AI for text, images, and video generation.
* **Governance Mechanism** : DAO-powered voting for protocol upgrades and decisions.
* **SDK for Developers** : Easy-to-use Python SDK to interact with Mementum's AI and blockchain features.
* **Security First** : Utilizes OpenZeppelin libraries, rigorous validation, and best practices.
