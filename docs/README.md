# Mementum Documentation

## Overview

Mementum is an AI-driven platform that combines trading automation, content generation, and decentralized governance using the Solana blockchain. The ecosystem revolves around **$MEME**, an ERC-20 (or equivalent) token, enabling AI-assisted trading, NFT minting, and governance mechanisms.

## Features

### 1. **AI Content Generation**

Mementum leverages multi-modal AI models to generate text, images, and videos. Developers can integrate these capabilities into their applications using the SDK.

### 2. **Blockchain Integration**

The platform provides seamless integration with the Solana blockchain through:

- **$MEME Token**: An ERC-20 token with secure implementations of minting, burning, and transfer functionalities.
- **Governance Mechanism**: A DAO-powered voting system for protocol upgrades and decisions.
- **NFT Minting**: Create and manage NFTs representing memes or other digital content.
- **Staking Rewards**: Earn rewards by staking $MEME tokens.

### 3. **SDK for Developers**

The Python SDK allows developers to interact with Mementum's AI and blockchain features. Key modules include:

- **AI Module**: Generate multi-modal content.
- **Blockchain Module**: Interact with smart contracts for token transfers, staking, and governance.
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for data validation, logging, and error handling.

### 4. **Scripts for Deployment and Management**

Pre-built scripts simplify tasks like deploying contracts, minting tokens, creating governance proposals, and executing airdrops.

### 5. **Examples for Quick Integration**

Ready-to-run example scripts demonstrate basic and advanced usage of the SDK.

## Architecture

### 1. **Frontend**

The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform's features, including AI content generation, token management, and governance.

### 2. **Backend**

The backend handles REST or GraphQL endpoints for the platform's services, such as submitting content, managing user profiles, and processing AI requests.

### 3. **Smart Contracts**

The smart contracts are the backbone of the Mementum ecosystem, providing secure and modular functionality for token management, governance, and additional features like NFT minting and staking.

### 4. **AI Services**

AI services are abstracted behind the SDK, allowing developers to generate multi-modal content without worrying about the underlying model details.

## Principles

- **Security First**: All contracts and SDK components follow best practices, including OpenZeppelin libraries and rigorous validation.
- **Modularity**: Each component is designed to be modular, allowing for easy upgrades and extensions.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive documentation, examples, and scripts ensure a smooth developer experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with Mementum, install the SDK:

```bash
pip install mementum-sdk
